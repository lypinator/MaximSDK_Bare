## Description

This example demonstrates the use of the HW CRC calculator.  The example first generates a CRC over 100 bytes.  The resulting CRC is inverted and placed at the end of the 100 bytes.  Another CRC is then calculated over the resulting 101 bytes.  The final result is compared with the expected value.  This sequence is repeated twice - once using the blocking CRC functions and once using the non-blocking (asynchronous) functions.

## Setup
##### Building Firmware:
Before building firmware you must select the correct value for _BOARD_  in "Makefile", either "EvKit\_V1" or "FTHR\_RevA", depending on the EV kit you are using to run the example.

After doing so, navigate to the directory where the example is located using a terminal window. Enter the following comand to build all of the files needed to run the example.

```
$ make
```

##### Required Connections:
If using the standard EV Kit (EvKit_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

If using the Featherboard (FTHR_RevA):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:
